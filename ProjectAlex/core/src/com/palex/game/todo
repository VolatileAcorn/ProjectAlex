Tips

Urgent
-Work out how items should be created, how to access them by ItemID, how to store Items
-Similar problem for Agents

In Agent
-setters for stats, maybe incrementer don't forgot "normal" types
-implement equip / unequip (after Equipment and weapon item classes are implemented)
-add methods that deal will equipment inventory skills

EquipmentSlots class
-needs all relevant methods after item classes and consequential classes implemented

Item classes
-make Item class
-make EquipmentItem class (can be equipped to only a certain type of slot)
-make WeaponItem class (a weapon is a piece of equipment which has skill)
-make ResourceItem class (basically just have value and can be sold)
-make UsableItem class (has some sort of effect on stats)

Skill class
-attack method will go in Agent some switch statement, work out how to start attack, then get input some time later, then calculate, and update Agents (maybe set some flag(s) in the battle manager)
-are different classes needed for different skill types, meybz not

Factories
-make a skill factory class which has all skill (can get reference by id)
-make an item factory class which has all items (can get reference by id)

Managers
-make a battle manager (start)

Input Handler
