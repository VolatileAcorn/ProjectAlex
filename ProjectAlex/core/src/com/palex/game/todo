Tips
-can use ints just make sure the getters and setters deal with it and is well documented (encapsulate)

In Agent
-setters for stats, maybe incrementer don't forgot "normal" types
-implement equip / unequip (after Equipment and weapon item classes are implemented)

Elsewhere

Maybe make an equipmentSlots class for the agent that deals with each equipment slot as an individual field (try not to crowd agent class)

Item classes
-make Item class
-make EquipmentItem class (can be equipped to only a certain type of slot)
-make WeaponItem class (a weapon is a piece of equipment which has skills)
-make ResourceItem class (basically just have value and can be sold)
-make UsableItem class (has some sort of effect on stats)

Factories
-make a skill factory class which has all skills (can get reference by id)
-make an item factory class which has all equipment (can get reference by id)

Managers
-make a battle manager (start)
