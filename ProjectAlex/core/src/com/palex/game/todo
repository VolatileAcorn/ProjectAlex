-needs all relevant methods after item classes and consequential classes implemented

Item classes

-make EquipmentItem class (can be equipped to only a certain type of slot)
-make WeaponItem class (a weapon is a piece of equipment which has skill)
-make ResourceItem class (basically just have value and can be sold)
-make UsableItem class (has some sort of effect on stats)

Skill class
-work out how a skill will work, how can we get a variety of moves
-each skill type is a different skill class like weapon
-basics (power, combo(one finger death punch style))
-weapons have elements which then modify the skill (or should both have (maybe introduce different skill types e.g drain, status, ultimate))

-make one and make it function as before

Factories
-make a skill factory class which has all skill (can get reference by id)
-make an item factory class which has all items (can get reference by id)
