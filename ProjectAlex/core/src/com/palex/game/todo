Tips


In Agent
-setters for stats, maybe incrementer don't forgot "normal" types
-implement equip / unequip (after Equipment and weapon item classes are implemented)

Elsewhere

Maybe make an equipmentSlots class for the agent that deals with each equipment slot as an individual field (try not to crowd agent class)

Item classes
-make Item class
-make EquipmentItem class (can be equipped to only a certain type of slot)
-make WeaponItem class (a weapon is a piece of equipment which has skill)
-make ResourceItem class (basically just have value and can be sold)
-make UsableItem class (has some sort of effect on stats)

Skill class
-work out how a skill will work, how can we get a variety of moves
-basics (power, element, combo(skill based rhythm))

Factories
-make a skill factory class which has all skill (can get reference by id)
-make an item factory class which has all equipment (can get reference by id)

Managers
-make a battle manager (start)
