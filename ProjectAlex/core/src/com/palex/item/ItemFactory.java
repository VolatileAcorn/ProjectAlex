    //Different lists will have different types of items stored in them
    //ItemID 0-999 = Resources, 1000-1999 = Weapons, 2000-2999 = ArmourSet etc
    //Resources are probably standard
    //Deleting makes adding so much less efficient since its harder to search for next spot


    //Could i store items using item type and itemid that way i wouldn't run out of space fullstop the list could just grow and have no collisions
